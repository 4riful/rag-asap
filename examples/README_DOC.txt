# RAG-ASAP Documentation

## Overview

RAG-ASAP is a minimal implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) designed for quick local experimentation and learning. This project provides a simple, single-file demo that demonstrates the core concepts of RAG without external dependencies.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. Instead of relying solely on a language model's training data, RAG first retrieves relevant documents or passages from a knowledge base, then uses that context to generate more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## How RAG-ASAP Works

The current implementation uses a naive approach for demonstration:

1. **Document Indexing**: Text is split into chunks (paragraphs) and stored in memory
2. **Query Processing**: User queries are processed by finding the chunk with the most word overlap
3. **Response Generation**: The most relevant chunk is returned as the answer

## Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies**: Runs with just Python standard library
- **Local Processing**: All operations happen locally, no external API calls
- **Simple Architecture**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Educational**: Perfect for learning RAG concepts

## Usage

Run the demo with:
```bash
python app.py "your question here"
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:
- Vector embeddings for better semantic search
- Multiple document support
- FAISS integration for efficient similarity search
- HuggingFace transformers integration
- Docker containerization
- Web interface

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Areas for improvement:
- Better chunking strategies
- More sophisticated retrieval methods
- Additional backends (FAISS, Chroma, etc.)
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation improvements
