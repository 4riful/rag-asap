RAG ASAP - Example Document

This file contains short paragraphs to demo retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
RAG combines a retrieval step (finding relevant passages) with a generation step (synthesizing an answer).
This lightweight demo uses simple paragraph chunking and either an overlap heuristic or sentence-transformers for semantic search.

Usage: ask a one-sentence question such as "what is RAG?" or "how do I run the demo?"
The demo will return the most relevant paragraph(s) from this document.
